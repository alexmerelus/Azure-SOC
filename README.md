Building a Honeynet + SOC with Azure
![Whiteboard design (1)](https://github.com/alexmerelus/Azure-SOC/assets/138509128/ca555d1f-b99f-4d3f-b9c0-14c741a7d3e9)
# Introduction
The image depicts a schematic for a Cloud Honeynet combined with a Security Operations Center (SOC), illustrating the cybersecurity infrastructure using Microsoft Azure cloud services. It outlines the flow of security data and interaction between components such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), SQL Databases, and Virtual Machines. These components are interconnected, with traffic filtered and monitored by Network Security Groups (NSGs). Data from the infrastructure flows into Azure's Log Analytics Workspace for examination, which then feeds into Azure Sentinel, the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system that offers threat detection, alerting, and visualization through various maps and incident reports. The diagram conveys the integration of these elements into a cohesive cybersecurity strategy, emphasizing the use of a honeynet—a decoy system intended to attract and analyze cyber attacks—as part of the SOC's defensive and monitoring operations. While the image aims to present a technical blueprint, its intent is clear: to showcase a robust cybersecurity setup within the Azure cloud ecosystem.
